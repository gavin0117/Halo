    <p>When I was younger, I remember visiting my cousins house and for <strong>christmas</strong> 
    and seeing them play <strong>Halo 2</strong>. I would later go home and watch 
    <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4_21RT3bCE >YouTube</a> videos about it. This website has information about old Halo games. It will also host an array of 
  old Halo images, videos, and links to archived websites. The image below is gameplay of Halo 2. Thank you for visiting!</p>
